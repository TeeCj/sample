# BY U3166730
Welcome to the "Aboriginal Places in Canberra" one-page website! This project is dedicated to shedding light on the rich cultural heritage of the Canberra region's Aboriginal communities. By exploring this site, you will embark on a journey to discover and appreciate the significance of various Aboriginal sites in this area. 

# TOPIC
From the examples provided, the best option for me was "Abroginal Places in ACT". Since this topic was an opportunity for me to learn more about the abroginal history and cultural heritage sites in Canberra.

Canberra and its surrounding regions are home to a multitude of culturally significant locations that hold immense historical value for the Aboriginal people. This one-page website serves as an educational resource and a platform for storytelling. Here, I aim to provide information about these sites, their cultural importance, and the stories they carry.

# MISSION
